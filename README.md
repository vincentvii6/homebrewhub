#HomebrewHub
This project is a website for Code Louisville that will be a resource for homebrewers to learn and share with others.
Details for brewing history, brewing how-to's, brewing equipment, and beer repices will be added to the site in the future.
A forum with user accounts is also in the planning stages.
